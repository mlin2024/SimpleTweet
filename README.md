# Project 3 - *SimpleTweet*

**SimpleTweet** is an android app that allows a user to view their Twitter timeline and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **~18** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x]	User can **sign in to Twitter** using OAuth login
* [x]	User can **view tweets from their home timeline**
  * [x] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
  * [x] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
* [x] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  * [x] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
  * [x] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to Twitter
  * [x] User is taken back to home timeline with **new tweet visible** in timeline
  * [x] Newly created tweet should be manually inserted into the timeline and not rely on a full refresh
* [x] User can **see a counter with total number of characters left for tweet** on compose tweet page
* [x] User can **pull down to refresh tweets timeline**
* [x] User can **see embedded image media within a tweet** on list or detail view.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] User is using **"Twitter branded" colors and styles**
* [ ] User sees an **indeterminate progress indicator** when any background or network task is happening
* [ ] User can **select "reply" from home timeline to respond to a tweet**
  * [ ] User that wrote the original tweet is **automatically "@" replied in compose**
* [x] User can tap a tweet to **open a detailed tweet view**
  * [ ] User can **take favorite (and unfavorite) or retweet** actions on a tweet
* [x] User can view more tweets as they scroll with infinite pagination
* [ ] Compose tweet functionality is built using modal overlay
* [ ] User can **click a link within a tweet body** on tweet details view. The click will launch the web browser with relevant page opened.
* [ ] Replace all icon drawables and other static image assets with [vector drawables](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Drawables#vector-drawables) where appropriate.
* [ ] User can view following / followers list through any profile they view.
* [ ] Use the View Binding library to reduce view boilerplate.
* [ ] On the Twitter timeline, apply scrolling effects such as [hiding/showing the toolbar](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Using-the-App-ToolBar#reacting-to-scroll) by implementing [CoordinatorLayout](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Handling-Scrolls-with-CoordinatorLayout#responding-to-scroll-events).
* [ ] User can **open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets**. Persisted in SQLite tweets are refreshed on every application launch. While "live data" is displayed when app can get it from Twitter API, it is also saved for use in offline mode.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Retweets are labeled as having been tweeted by their original author, with text indicating who retweeted it.
* [x] Extra image links are removed from tweet body.
* [x] When the user posts a tweet, the tweet is not truncated, unlike the JSON tweet object returned from the POST request.
* [x] The tweet detail view shows the timestamp in the same format as the official Twitter for Android app.

## Notes

A roadblock I got stuck on for several hours was the simple matter of putting the tweet timestamp right after the Twitter handle, but ellipsizing the twitter
handle if their combined length was too long to fit on the screen. I eventually stumbled across a workaround that involves multiple nested container views,
but it works as intented and looks just like the format used in the official Twitter for Android app.

I also struggled with removing the extra links from tweets. Tweets that included media all had a Twitter URL appended to their body text that linked to the
actual media on Twitter. Since this link does not appear on the official Twitter for Android app, I removed it using regular expressions.

My app still continues to have several bugs - the user cannot tweet more than once in a session or the app will crash, and sometimes tweet body text will not
appear in the timeline activity but will appear in the detail activity. I intend to return to these bugs once I gain more experience in Android development.
